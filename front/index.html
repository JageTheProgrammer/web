                <h6>Coding is the process of writing instructions for computers to follow, using programming languages like Python, Java, or JavaScript. These instructions enable software, websites, and applications to function. Coding involves logic, problem-solving, and creativity, as developers translate real-world tasks into algorithms that a computer can execute. It's like speaking the language of machines, but with endless possibilities for what can be built. Whether it’s building a simple website, creating games, or developing complex AI systems, coding is a skill that powers much of the digital world around us, and it continues to grow in importance across industries.
